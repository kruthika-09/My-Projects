        Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities.
        Kashi, its ancient name, was associated with a kingdom of the same name
        of 2,500 years ago. The Lion capital of Ashoka at nearby Sarnath has
        been interpreted to be a commemoration of the Buddha's first sermon
        there in the fifth century BCE. In the 8th century, Adi Shankara
        established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi.
        Tulsidas wrote his Awadhi language epic, the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti
        movement reworking of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in Varanasi.
